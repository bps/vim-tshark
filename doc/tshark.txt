*tshark.txt*    Plugin for reading a pcap via tshark

Author: Brian Smyth <http://bsmyth.net>
License: Same terms as Vim itself (see |license|)

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set and Vim has the
folding feature.

SUMMARY

This plugin allows you to :edit a pcap file that you collected via tcpdump or
tshark. It will use tshark to make the pcap human-readable and provides
support for folding the pcap, so you can view the high level at a glance and
open folds to get more information.

CONFIGURATION

g:tshark_nested_folds
    Set true to create a fold for each protocol layer. Otherwise, you'll get
    each frame as a fold.
g:tshark_summary_opts
    Set the tshark command line options for the foldtext summaries.
g:tshark_detail_opts
    Set the tshark command line options for the detailed dump.
g:tshark_bin
    Set the tshark binary, including a full path if needed.
